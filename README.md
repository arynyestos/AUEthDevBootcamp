# Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp

🎓 I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed the Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp, earning an NFT certificate of completion! 🌟

🔐 Throughout this intensive course, I've mastered crucial skills that are in high demand in the blockchain industry, making me a strong candidate for any forward-thinking company looking to hire a blockchain developer. Here are some of the highlights from the course that make me a valuable asset:

🔗 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗿𝘆𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝘆: I delved deep into the fundamentals of blockchain cryptography, understanding how cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, and public-key cryptography are at the core of secure and transparent blockchain networks.

⛓️ 𝗕𝗹𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: I learned about the architecture and data structures that power blockchain networks, including UTXO vs. Account Models, Merkle Trees, Ethereum Tries, and more.

💼 𝗘𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲𝘂𝗺 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆: I gained hands-on experience with Ethereum, from understanding its features and gas system to sending transactions, working with Ethereum accounts, and using Ethers.js for front-end development.

🤖 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗲: I honed my skills in writing smart contracts using Solidity, explored data types, functions, and communication between contracts. I can now create and interact with smart contracts confidently.

🌐 𝗪𝗲𝗯3 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: With a strong foundation in Web3 development, I can build decentralized applications (dApps) and understand how to connect them to the Ethereum blockchain.

🔍 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀: I've covered advanced topics such as event handling, escrow contracts, ERC-20 tokens, and even ventured into non-fungible tokens (NFTs), adding versatility to my blockchain development toolkit.

🔄 𝗨𝗽𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗚𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲: I've explored concepts like proxy contracts, libraries, and smart contract upgradeability, as well as how smart contract protocols are governed, ensuring adaptability in evolving blockchain ecosystems.

🌐 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗶𝘀𝗲: For the final project, I developed SummerPay, a smart payment system for people working outdoors in hot summer days. Doing this I gained extensive knowledge about Chainlink. I integrated Chainlink oracles, running my own node and external adapter, to incorporate real-time temperature data into payment calculations, showcasing my ability to work with cutting-edge blockchain technologies.

I'm thrilled to have completed this high-quality course, and I'm excited to apply these skills in real-world blockchain projects. 🌐💼 Thank you, Alchemy University, for this incredible learning journey!
